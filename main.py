Welcome to the REM Waste Accent Analysis Tool!
This application helps evaluate spoken English from video URLs for hiring purposes.
Enter a public video URL (e.g., Loom, direct MP4 link) below to get started.

**Note:** In this simulated environment, actual video-to-audio extraction and
advanced accent detection are not performed. The results shown are illustrative.
For a real-world application, you would integrate libraries like `moviepy`
(for audio extraction) and a robust machine learning model/API (for accent detection).
