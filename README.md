English Accent Detector (Simulated)
This repository contains a simulated Streamlit application designed to demonstrate the concept of an English accent detection tool for hiring purposes.

Objective
The primary objective of this tool is to:

Accept a public video URL (e.g., Loom or direct MP4 link).

(Simulated) Extract the audio from the video.

(Simulated) Analyze the speakerâ€™s accent to detect English language speaking candidates.

Output:

Classification of the accent (e.g., British, American, Australian, etc.)

A confidence in English accent score (e.g., 0-100%)

A short summary or explanation (optional)

Important Note: This version of the application simulates the audio extraction and accent detection processes. It uses random data for accent classification and confidence scores. For a real-world application, actual machine learning models and audio processing libraries would need to be integrated.

Technologies Used
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.

Python 3.9+

Local Setup and Running
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository (or save the app.py file):
If you have the app.py file, save it in a directory.

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:

pip install streamlit

Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py

This command will open the application in your default web browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

Docker Deployment
You can also run this application using Docker.

Ensure Docker is installed on your system.

Save the Streamlit application as app.py in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

Build the Docker image:
Navigate to the directory containing Dockerfile and app.py in your terminal, then run:

docker build -t accent-detector .

Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 8501:8501 accent-detector

This will start the Streamlit application inside a Docker container, accessible via your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Future Enhancements (For a Real-World Solution)
To transform this simulated tool into a fully functional solution, you would need to implement the following:

Actual Audio Extraction:

Integrate libraries like moviepy or ffmpeg to programmatically download and extract audio tracks from video URLs.

Handle various video formats (MP4, WebM, etc.) and potential network errors.

Robust Accent Detection Model:

Speech-to-Text (STT): Convert the extracted audio into text.

Accent Classification: Use a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., a deep learning model based on CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers) that has been trained on diverse English accents. This could involve:

Fine-tuning a pre-existing speech recognition model.

Using a dedicated accent recognition API (if available).

The model should output a classification (e.g., "American", "British") and a confidence score.

Error Handling and User Feedback:

More comprehensive error handling for invalid URLs, video processing failures, and model prediction issues.

Clearer feedback to the user during long-running processes (e.g., "Extracting audio...", "Analyzing accent...").

Scalability:

Consider deploying the accent detection model as a separate microservice if processing needs to scale.
Security:

Ensure secure handling of video URLs and any processed data.

Implement authentication and authorization if the tool is to be used by multiple internal users.
